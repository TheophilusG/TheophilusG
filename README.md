## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒŸ Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate explorer driven by a desire to build impactful solutions and share knowledge with the world. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of CS, Maths, app/web development and transformative technologies like AI, LLMs, HCI, and UX.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I am primarily focused on building & launching CampusCools, 2 consumer social apps (Tarpit ideas) that aims to revolutionize the way you socialize. I also occasionally publish my thoughts on my medium where I offer some questions and the knowledge I gained through my unique experiences.

ðŸ’¡ I believe in the power of collaboration and am always looking for exciting projects that make a difference. If you're spearheading an impactful project that seeks to make a difference, feel free to connect with me in the platform of your choice through the buttons below or the links in my profile
